## Overview

### Users are able to

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Flexbox, Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS :has pseudo-class
- CSS Custom Properties
- Windows.localstorage

### What I learned

```css
/* css */
:root:has(#dark:checked),
body.dark {
  --main-background: hsl(222, 26%, 31%);
  --toggle-background: hsl(223, 31%, 20%);
  --screen-background: hsl(224, 36%, 15%);
  /*...*/
}
```
I utilized `:has` to switch the color theme of the calculator. However, currently (Feb 2023) `:has` is not compatible with Firefox and Samsung Browser. so I made a fallback for better compatibility.
```js
// javascript, prefers-color-scheme
lightMode.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  if (e.matches) {
    document.body.className = lightTheme.id;
    lightTheme.checked = true;
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "light");
  } else {
    document.body.className = darkTheme.id;
    darkTheme.checked = true;
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
  }
});
```
Using `window.matchMedia.matches` with `prefers-color-scheme`, Users can have their initial theme preferene checked and have any additional changes saved in the browser with `localstorage`.


### Continued development
- add a feature that copy with one click could be added next to main display
